Computing in public datacenters requires users to trust their chosen Cloud Service Provider with access to the data their computations require. 
Given the sensitive nature of certain types of data, this is often undesirable.
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a cryptographically secure, though computationally expensive,
method of performing computations on encrypted data.
To make homomorphically encrypted computations perform sufficiently well to be practically usable, 
we propose a novel programmable VLIW vector architecture.
We also propose techniques to efficiently map FHE programs onto this architecture.
