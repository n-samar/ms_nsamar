Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables offloading computation to untrusted
servers with cryptographic privacy. Despite its attractive security, FHE is not
yet widely~adopted due to its prohibitive overheads, about 10,000$\times$ over
unencrypted computation.

We propose to develop CraterLake, the first FHE accelerator that enables FHE programs of
\emph{unbounded} size. To
tackle this challenge, CraterLake introduces a new hardware architecture that
efficiently scales to very large ciphertexts, novel functional units to
accelerate key kernels, and new algorithms to reduce
data movement.
