Time & Work Description \\
\hline
Summer 2020 & Gain a functional understanding of FHE systems, algorithms, and
 their implementations\\
Nov 2020 & Begin implementing scheduling algorithm, understand heuristics and their tradeoffs. Create dataflow graph for logistic regression.\\
Dec 2020-Jan 2021 & Improve scheduling algorithm, investigate different accelerator designs, and implement dataflow graph for neural network. Additionally, understand the differences between BGV and CKKS dataflow graphs.\\
Feb-Mar 2021 & Complete scheduling algorithm, focusing specifically on register allocation and FHE bootstrapping.\\
Apr 2021 & Perform design space explorations using the completed scheduling algorithm.\\
May 2021 & Compile results, understand fair comparisons against prior work, and run further experiments.\\
