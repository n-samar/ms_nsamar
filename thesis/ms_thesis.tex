\chapter{F1: A Fast and Programmable Accelerator for Computation on Encrypted Data}

In this chapter we present F1, the first FHE accelerator that is
programm\-able, i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs. F1 builds on an
in-depth architectural analysis of the characteristics of FHE computations that
reveals acceleration opportunities. F1 is a wide-vector processor with novel
functional units deeply specialized to FHE primitives, such as modular
arithmetic, number-theoretic transforms, and automorphisms. This
organization provides so much compute throughput that data movement becomes the
key bottleneck. Thus, F1 is primarily designed to minimize data movement.
Hardware provides an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and mechanisms to
decouple data movement from execution. A novel compiler leverages these
mechanisms to maximize reuse and schedule off-chip and on-chip data movement.

We will describe F1's architecture (\autoref{sec:f1_arch}), scheduler
(\autoref{sec:f1_scheduler}), functional units (\autoref{sec:f1_fus}), and
results (\autoref{sec:f1_evaluation}).

\section{Summary}

F1 is the first FHE accelerator that is programmable, i.e., capable of
executing full FHE programs. In contrast to prior accelerators, which build
fixed pipelines tailored to specific FHE schemes and parameters, F1 introduces
a more effective design approach: it accelerates the \emph{primitive}
computations shared by higher-level operations using novel high\hyp{}throughput
functional units, and hardware and compiler are co-designed to minimize data
movement, the key bottleneck in FHE. This flexibility makes F1 broadly useful: the
same hardware can accelerate all operations within a program, arbitrary FHE
programs, and even multiple FHE schemes. In short, our key contribution is to
show that, for FHE, we can achieve ASIC-level performance without sacrificing
programmability.

\chapter{CraterLake: An Accelerator for Efficient Unbounded Computation on Encrypted Data}\label{ch:craterlake}

In this chapter we present CraterLake, the first FHE accelerator that enables
FHE programs of \emph{unbounded} size (i.e., unbounded multiplicative depth).
Such computations require very large ciphertexts (tens of MBs each) and
different algorithms that prior work does not support well. To tackle this
challenge, CraterLake introduces a new hardware architecture that efficiently
scales to very~large ciphertexts, novel functional units to accelerate key
kernels, and new algorithms and compiler techniques to reduce data movement.

We will present an architectural overview of CraterLake
(\autoref{sec:overview}); we then discuss its microarchitecture
(\autoref{sec:architecture}); (\autoref{sec:architecture}), compiler and
scheduler (\autoref{sec:compiler}) implementation
(\autoref{sec:implementation}), experimental methodology
(\autoref{sec:methodology}), and results (\autoref{sec:results}).

\section{Summary}

For widespread adoption of FHE, accelerators must efficiently support deep
computations. CraterLake is the first accelerator to achieve this. By adopting
state-of-the-art algorithms and using them to design CraterLake, we target a
new regime of FHE not explored by prior approaches. Through new architectural
and compiler techniques, CraterLake addresses the overheads of deep
computations and provides an order-of-magnitude speedups over prior
accelerators, which scale poorly to the accelerator sizes required to process
very large ciphertexts, and are inefficient on the algorithms needed by deep
computations. As a result, CraterLake enables new applications for FHE, such as
real-time inference using deep neural networks like ResNet or LSTMs.
