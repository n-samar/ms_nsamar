Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables
offloading computation to untrusted servers with cryptographic privacy.
Despite its attractive security,
FHE is not yet widely~adopted due to its prohibitive overheads,
about 10,000$\times$ over unencrypted computation.

We first present F1, the first \emph{programmable} FHE accelerator,
i.e., capable of executing full FHE programs. F1 is a wide-vector
processor with novel functional units deeply specialized to FHE
primitives. When introduced, F1 outperformed state-of-the-art software implementations
by gmean 5,400$\times$.

Then, we present \name, the first FHE accelerator that enables
FHE programs of \emph{unbounded} size
(i.e., programs with unbounded multiplicative depth).
Such computations require very large ciphertexts (tens of MBs each)
and different algorithms that prior work does not support well.
To tackle this challenge, \name introduces a new hardware architecture
that efficiently scales to very~large ciphertexts,
novel functional units to accelerate key kernels,
and new algorithms and compiler techniques to reduce data movement.

We evaluate \name on deep FHE programs,
including deep neural networks like ResNet and LSTMs,
where prior work takes minutes to hours per inference on a CPU.
\name outperforms a CPU by gmean 4,600$\times$ and
F1 by 11.2$\times$ under similar area
and power budgets.
These speeds enable for the first time real-time performance
on unbounded FHE programs.
