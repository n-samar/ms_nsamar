Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables offloading computation to untrusted
servers with cryptographic privacy. Despite its attractive security, FHE is not
yet widely~adopted due to its prohibitive overheads, about 10,000$\times$ over
unencrypted computation.

We propose to develop F1, the first programmable FHE accelerator, delivering
5,400$\times$ speedups on shallow FHE programs. We also propose CraterLake, the
first FHE accelerator that enables FHE programs of \emph{unbounded} depth,
delivering 12.3$\times$ speedups over F1.
