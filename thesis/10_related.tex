\chapter{Additional Related Work}\label{sec:related}

We now present related work not discussed so far.

\paragraph{HE-MPC accelerators are hampered by communication:}
To avoid the overheads of FHE, recent work has proposed accelerators
for private deep learning
that combine shallow homomorphic encryption (HE) with multi-party computation (MPC):
Gazelle~\cite{juvekar2018gazelle} and Cheetah~\cite{reagen:hpca21:cheetah}.
These systems require very frequent communication with the client,
essentially after every single level of multiplication.
So while they reduce accelerator overheads, they are limited by high client-server communication
and client encryption/decryption overheads.
Delphi~\cite{mishra2020delphi} shows that each DNN inference takes gigabytes of traffic,
which dominates performance; yet, the above accelerators do not consider this traffic.
CHOCO~\cite{vanderhagen:arxiv21:choco} shows that, even after accelerating client operations,
communication costs dominate.

By dramatically accelerating bootstrapping, \name eliminates the high communication costs of HE-MPC and shallow HE designs.
To avoid bootstrapping, these prior approaches require the \emph{client} to receive, reencrypt, and resend ciphertexts that have exhausted their multiplicative budgets.
In our benchmarks, avoiding each bootstrapping would require transferring over 13\,MB between client and server
(as the client must resend the ciphertext with a reasonable noise budget).
Even if we ignore client computation and network latency, on a 100\,Mbps connection this would
require over 1 \emph{second} per ciphertext.
By contrast, \name bootstraps this ciphertext in 3.9\,ms, 256$\times$ faster.
Bootstrapping also allows the client to send narrow inputs (e.g., with 32 instead of 1,500 bits per coefficient),
which the server can bootstrap before computation.
This greatly reduces encryption and network overheads.

\paragraph{GPUs are inefficient on FHE:}
Prior work has studied the use of GPUs to accelerate FHE~\cite{wang:hpec12:fhe-gpu,wang:tc13:fhe-gpu,wang:iscas14:leveled-gpu,al:emerging19:implementation,jung2021over}.
While the data-parallel nature of GPUs may seem a good fit for FHE, these efforts achieve modest speedups over multicore CPUs.
This is because GPUs lack modular arithmetic, cannot implement all-to-all operations like NTTs and automorphisms efficiently,
and their on-chip memories are too small to enable sufficient reuse (\autoref{fig:gmeanVsStorage}), despite their use of HBM. Specifically, state-of-the-art GPU approaches carefully tune algorithms to achieve high off- and on-chip bandwidth utilization~\cite{jung2021over}; however, \cite{jung2021over} is 200$\times$ slower than \name.
This shows that \name's high reuse is crucial: to achieve the same throughput as \name,
a GPU would need over 100\,TB/s of memory bandwidth.
